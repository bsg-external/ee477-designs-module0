// 
//  Clk Gen Module -- Students should implement their tunable clock generator
//  circuit here! The input and output port list has been created for you. Do
//  not modify the port list, this will break the rest of the lab :)
// 
//  First, you must figure out what logic gates are available to us in the
//  standard cell library. The best place to figure this out is the liberty
//  file which can be found at:
//
//      <SKY130_ROOT>/libs.ref/sky130_fd_sc_hd/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__ss_100C_1v60.lib
//
//  Open this file above to see the gates available in this cell library. This
//  will be helpful to figure out the names of the gates as well as the name of
//  the pins for the gates. Using this information you can instantiate the
//  cells you need for the circuit.
//
//  NOTE: This file is 100K lines, be sure to use the search function of your
//  text editor. Search for "cell " to find the each gate available in this
//  cell library. Under each cell definition, search for "pin " to find the
//  pins of the gate (you can ignore pg_pins, we do not need to work with
//  supply nets within this verilog file). Inside the pin definition will be
//  the "direction " to determine if it is an input or output of the gate.
//  Output pins will also have a "function " which is the boolean logic
//  expression for the gate. Timing information for each pin can also be found
//  within the pin definitions, please read the module - handout for more
//  information.

    // TODO: Implement the clock generator below! Make sure that:
    //  1. The ring ends at the B pin of the reset NOR gate below.
    //  2. The ring begins with the X pin of the reset_bal NOR gate below.
    //  3. Use the 4-bit select_i to choose between your 16 clock speeds.
    //  4. The final clock should drive the clk_o port.
